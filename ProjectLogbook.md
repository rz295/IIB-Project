## Project Logbook
---
### Wednesday - October 14th, 2020 - Rae + Phillip
In terms of next steps, Rae will need to:
*Complete Hazard Assessment Form
*Read the 3 suggested background materials sent (2 about Dimensional Function Synthesis and 1 about Machine Learning)

### Thursday - October 22nd, 2020 - Rae + Phillip
In terms of next steps, Rae will need to:
*Look into warp-data-stream repository, inspect the available sensing measurements and propose 6 potential sensing applications from adopting at least one sensor given (e.g. pendulum could be one of the possible applications)
*Look into pedometer repository, observe how the pedometer example is implemented and write in C for a pendulum example that takes in accelerometer or gyrometer data and outputs oscillation period
*Submit a project timeline proposal after having a better understanding of the project over this weekend

### Thursday - October 29th, 2020 - Rae + Phillip
Progress made following the last meeting:
*Available sensors from warp-data-stream repository include the following:
Infrared sensors; temperature sensors; accelerometers; magnetometers; gyroscopes; pressure sensors; humidity sensors; environmental sensors (Co2 and TVOC)
*At least one sensor from the above is chosen for the 6 potential sensing applications below:
i)	Pendulum
Accelerometer
ii)	Time of the day or air-conditioning functions
Temperature sensor; humidity sensor
iii)	Air Quality
Environmental sensors (Co2 and TVOC)
iv)	Industrial setting (e.g. test if the reduction in pressure of the gearbox is due to loss of oil or just increase in temperature due to friction)
Pressure sensor; temperature sensor
v)	Aircraftâ€™s altitude and heading reference system
Magnetometer; gyroscope; pressure sensor
vi)	Home security system for detecting motion
Infra-red sensor

### Thursday - November 5th, 2020 - Rae + Phillip
Progress made following the last meeting:
*Observe how the pedometer example is implemented and write in C for a pendulum example that takes in accelerometer or gyrometer data and outputs oscillation period:
A raw pendulum example file and makefile are written locally and the example file has been successfully compiled to compute period of a pendulum. 
However, I am still trying to make sense of the example pedometer folder in the repository and to figure out further modifications required in order to incorporate this new pendulum example into the repository. 
Vasileios mentioned that he is happy to guide me through this process

Progress reviewed: Some project marks are allocated for mid-of-term project review, project seems to be on track
Michaelmas Project Presentation is scheduled on Wednesday 25th November
